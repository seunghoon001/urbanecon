Introduction

We study the relationship between fuel efficiency and horsepower.

Data

We use the mtcars data set that comes with R.
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

Analysis

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(hp, mpg))
```

Conclusion

The plot shows that higher horsepower cars tend to have poorer fuel efficiency.
