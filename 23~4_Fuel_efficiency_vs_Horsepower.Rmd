### Introduction

We study the relationship between fuel efficiency and horsepower.

### Data

We use the mtcars data set that comes with R.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable( head(mtcars) )
```

### Analysis

```{r include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(hp, mpg))
```

### Conclusion

**The plot shows that *higher* horsepower cars tend to have *poorer* fuel efficiency.**
