## Three ways to run R codes

- Console
- R Script
- R Markdown

We will run the following codes, using each method.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)
```

## Console

Type the following codes in Console pane of RStudio, line by line.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)
```

Note that R shows the results in the same console or Viewer.

<!--  

---
mtcars is one of built-in datasets that come with R. To know more about the data set, type the following in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
? mtcars
```

A help screen will open for the mtcars dataset. Read the help.

You can also see help for the 'head' function or for anything you function you use in R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
? head
```

Note in the help, that default for n option is set at 6.

---

Suppose you want to create a scatter plot showing mpg against hp. Type the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)
```

mtcars\$hp and mtcars\$mpg pulls hp and mpg columns of the mtcars data frame. Try

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars$hp
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars$mpg
```
The plot function draws the scatter PLOT of the two numeric vectors.

The following calculates average mpg of the cars in the dataset.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

-->

## R Script

- One big disadvantage of Console is that it would be hard for you to reproduce or revise your analysis later. R Script allows you to save the whole codes as a file and thus to reproduce or revise them later.
- Click `File` - `New File` - `R Script` or press **ctrl/command-shft-N**. 
- In the new Script editor, type the following codes while pressing **ctrl-enter** instead of **enter** key:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars
mean(mtcars$mpg)
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)
```

- You can also run the whole program by pressing **ctrl-shift-enter** key.
- Save the program as a file by clicking `File`-`Save`. 

## R Markdown

- One disadvantage of the R Script approach is that the codes and outputs are separate.
- R Markdown allows you to write text, codes, and output in one document. This is very convenient when you have to write a report or a presentation based on your R analysis. For example, these slides are written in R Markdown.
- Click 'File - New File - R Markdown'. Replace the Title with "Fuel Efficiency vs. Horsepower" and click 'OK'. RStudio will generate a RMarkdown template you can revise.

- Delete everything below 'YAML header' and add the following:

<div class="width_80">
<img src="figures/R Markdown example - Fuel efficiency and horsepower 0.png" />
</div>

- You can add a blank code chunk by pressing **ctrl/cmd-alt-i**.
- As you type the codes, you can run each line in a chunk by pressing **ctrl/cmd-enter** or run the whole chunk by pressing **ctrl/cmd-shift-enter**.
- You can generate the whole document by clicking the **Knit** button or press **ctrl/command-shft-k**. It generates the report and its html file.

## Text Formatting

Revise the Rmd program as follows and `knit` the document. How does it change the output document?

<div class="width_80">
<img src="figures/R Markdown example - Fuel efficiency and horsepower.png" />
</div>

For more formatting options, see `Pandoc's Markdown` section of `R Markdown Cheat Sheet` in `Help` - `Cheatsheets` in `RStudio`.

## Code Chunk Options

<!--
- To hide code chunks and show only their output, use **echo=FALSE** chunk option.
- To show only code while not evaluating it (thus showing no output), use **eval=FALSE** chunk options.
-->

Revise the Rmd program as follows and `knit` the document. How does it change the output document?

<div class="width_80">
<img src="figures/R Markdown example - Fuel efficiency and horsepower 2.png" />
</div>

For more chunk options, see `Important Chunk Options` section of the `R Markdown Cheat Sheet`.

## Output Format

Note `output: html_document` in YAML header. When you knit it, you obtain a html file as its output.

You can choose a different output format (e.g., pdf, word) by modifying the line. See the `Set render options with YAML` section of the `R Markdown Cheat Sheet`.
